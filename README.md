# NYC Coronavirus Plots

The NYC COVID Plots notebook contains a pandemic dashboard as well as several other free-standing visualizations, all created with data from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

The dashboard started as a way for me to keep track of the pandemic in my city. 
I quickly became concerned with reporting delays, and decided to look at all previous uploads of one of the datasets in order to better interpret the latest numbers.

Update schedule dictated by my virus-related anxiety levels.
